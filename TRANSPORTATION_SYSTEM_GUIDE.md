## 🚀 How It Works

### **Step 1: Check Hotel Bookings** (Non-Referees Only)

When a user opens the Transportation page:
1. System fetches all hotel bookings for the user
2. Filters only **CONFIRMED** bookings
3. Calculates total capacity:
   - Counts all guests across all confirmed bookings
   - Example: Hotel A (5 guests) + Hotel B (3 guests) = **8 total capacity**

### **Step 2: Display Requirements**

If user has NO confirmed bookings:
- ⚠️ Show warning message
- 📝 Explain requirements
- 🔗 Provide link to Hotels page

If user has confirmed bookings:
- ✅ Show booking details (confirmation numbers, hotels, capacity)
- 📊 Display summary card with all booking info
- 🎯 Allow form access

### **Step 3: Fill Transportation Form**

User fills out:
1. **Phone Number** (required)
2. **Arrival Requests**:
   - Add multiple requests using "Add Arrival" button
   - Each request: flight, airport, terminal, date, time, team members
   - Select destination hotel (dropdown shows all booked hotels)
3. **Departure Requests**:
   - Add multiple requests using "Add Departure" button
   - Each request: same fields as arrival
   - Select departure hotel

### **Step 4: Validation**

System validates:
- ✅ All fields are filled
- ✅ Hotel is selected for each request (non-referees)
- ✅ Total team members ≤ hotel capacity (non-referees)
- ✅ Phone number is provided

### **Step 5: Submit**

If validation passes:
- 📤 Save to Firestore `transportationRequests` collection
- ✅ Success message shown
- 🔄 Form resets after 3 seconds
- 📧 (Future: Email notification sent)

  allow update: if isAuthenticated() && 
                   (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
