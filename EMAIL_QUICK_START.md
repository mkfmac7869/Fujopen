## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Domain Setup**

### Current Status
- Using: `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend test email)
- This works but emails may go to **SPAM** ⚠️

### To Fix (Use Your Own Domain)

**Option 1: Keep Test Email (Easiest for Now)**
- Just check **SPAM folder** when testing
- Perfect for development

**Option 2: Use Your Domain (Recommended for Production)**
1. **Login to Resend**: https://resend.com
2. **Add Domain**: Click "Domains" → "Add Domain"
3. **Enter**: `fujairahopen.com`
4. **Add DNS Records**: Copy the 3 DNS records Resend gives you
5. **Update Your DNS** at your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
6. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS to propagate
7. **Verify** in Resend dashboard
8. **Update Code**: Edit `awrora-react/lib/emailService.js` line 6:
   ```javascript
   const FROM_EMAIL = 'Fujairah Open 2026 <noreply@fujairahopen.com>';
   ```
