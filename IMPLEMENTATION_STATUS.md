# 🚀 Transportation System - Implementation Status

## ✅ **COMPLETED FEATURES**

### 1. **Enhanced Transportation Form** ✅
**File**: `components/Transportation/TransportationForm.js`

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Referee bypass logic (no restrictions)
- ✅ Hotel booking requirement check for non-referees
- ✅ Fetch and display confirmed hotel bookings
- ✅ Calculate total team member capacity
- ✅ Multiple arrival requests with add/remove functionality
- ✅ Multiple departure requests with add/remove functionality

- ✅ Route display (Airport → Hotel or Hotel → Airport)
- ✅ Real-time capacity validation
- ✅ Comprehensive form validation
- ✅ Summary display showing total requests and capacity
- ✅ Beautiful UI with loading states and error messages

**Key Logic**:
```javascript
// Capacity validation
const totalRequested = calculateTotalTeamMembers();
if (totalRequested > totalCapacity) {
  error("Exceeds hotel booking capacity");
}

// Hotel requirement check
if (!isReferee && !hasConfirmedBooking) {
  showWarningScreen();
}
```
